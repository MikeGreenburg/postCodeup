//        int userAge2[];

    //        ARRAY METHODS

    //In order to use array methods we need the following and must appear after the package statement and before the class declaration
    import java.util.Arrays;


    //Example
//    package helloworld;
//
//    import java.util.Arrays;
//
//    public class HelloWorld {
    //code for HelloWorld class
//    }

    //equals() is used to determine if two arrays are equal to each other and returns true or false
    int[] arr1 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
    int[] arr2 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
    int[] arr3 = {10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0};

    boolean result1 = Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2); //returns true
    boolean result2 = Arrays.equals(arr1, arr3); //returns false because elements are not arranged the same

    //copyOfRanged() allows you to copy the contents of one array into another and requires three arguments
    int[] source = {12, 1, 5, -2, 16, 14, 18, 20, 25};

    //To copy contents use the first argument "source" is the array that provides the values to be copied. The next two arguments tell the compiler which indexes to start and stop copying. Returns {-2, 16, 14, 18} while "source" remains unchanged.
    int[] dest = Arrays.copyOfRange(source, 3, 7);

    //toString returns a String that represents the contents of an array.
    int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    //use below to display contents of the numbers array
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
    //Returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    //sort() allows for arrays to be sorted. It takes in an array as the argument
    int[] numbers2 = {12, 1, 5, -2, 16, 14};

    //below will sort the array in ascending order

    Arrays.sort(numbers2);

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers2));
    //Returns {-2, 1, 5, 12, 14, 16}


    //binarySearch() allows you to search for a specific value in a sorted array
    int[] myInt = {21, 23, 34, 45, 56, 78, 99};

    //to determine if 78 is in the array use the following
    int foundIndex = Arrays.binarySearch(myInt, 78);
    //foundIndex will return 5

    int foundIndex2 = Arrays.binarySearch(myInt, 39);
    //foundIndex will return -4 the "-" means that 39 is not found and the 4 tells you where it should exist in the array and adds one to that result, 3+1 = 4..

    //      FINDING ARRAY LENGTH

    int[] userAge = {21, 22, 26, 32, 40};

    userAge.length; //returns 5 because there are 5 ages in the array

    //     DISPLAYING OUTPUT

    System.out.ptintln("Hello ");
    //Returns "Hello"

    System.out.println("How are yout?");
    //Returns "Hello
    //How are you?

    System.out.print("Hello");
    System.out.print("How are you?");
    //Returns "Hello How are you?"

    //Displaying simple text

    System.out.println("Hi, my name is Jamie");
    //Returns "Hi, my name is Jamie

    //Displaying the value of a variable
    int number = 30;

    System.out.println(number);
    //Returns 30
    //If number is written ("number") output will be number since it is in string form

    //Displaying results without assigning them to variables
    System.out.println(35+5);
    //Returns 35
    //To display the result method use
    System.out.println("Oracle".substring(1, 4));
    //Retuns "rac" as 1 tells it to start at this index and it stops at index 4 but does not include it.

    //Using Concatenation sign
    System.out.println("Hello, " + "how are you?" + " I love Java.");
    //Returns "Hello, how are you? I love Java."

    //Concatenate strings with variables
    int results = 79;
    System.out.println("You scored " + results + " marks for your test.");
    //Returns "You scored 79 marks for your test."

    //Concatenate strings with mathematical expressions
    System.out.println("The sum of 50 and 2 is " + (50 + 2) + ".");
    //Returns The sum of 50 and 2 is 52 the () with the "50 + 2" forces the compiler to evaluate the expression first to avoid errors.

    //    ESCAPE SEQUENCES

    //Use \ as the escape character to print characters that would otherwise have different meanings
    System.out.println("Hello\tWorld");
    //Returns "Hello     World" with a tab or 5 spaces inbetween them.

    //Print a new line (\n)
    System.out.println("Hello\nWorld");
    //Returns "Hello
    //World"

    //Print \ character (\\)
    System.out.println("\\");
    //Returns \

    //Print double quotes (\")
    System.out.println("I am 5'9\" tall");
    //Returns I am 5 '9" tall


    //     FORMATTING OUTPUTS

    System.out.println("The answer for 5.45 divided by 3 is " + (5.45/3));
    //Returns The answer for 5.45 divided by 3 is 1.8166666666666667
    //So instead use printf

    System.out.printf("The answer for %.3f divided by %d is %.2f.", 5.45, 3, 5.45/3);
    //Returns The answer for 5.450 divided by 3 is 1.82. I passed four arguments but only one is needed.
    //The f in %.3f represents a float
    //The d in %d represents a double
    //The first %.3f is replaced by the first argument that is 5.45. The 3 in %.3f represents the 3 decimal points (.450)
    //The second %d is replaced by the second argument 3
    //The third %.2f is represented by the answer. The 2 in %.2f represents the 2 decimal points (.82)

    //     CONVERTERS

    //Integer converter d
    //Used for formatting integers
    System.out.printf("%d", 12);
    //Returns 12

    System.out.printf("%d", 12.9);
    //Returns an error as 12.9 is not an integer

    System.out.printf("%f", 12);
    //Returns an error as 12 is not a floating point number

    //Newline converter n
    System.out.printf("%d%n%d", 12, 3);
    //Returns 12
    //3

    //The width flag
    //Is used to specify total width
    System.out.printf("%8d", 12);
    //Returns       12 with 6 spaces in front of the 12 to give it a total width of 8

    System.out.printf("%8.2f", 12.4);
    //Returns    12.40 with 3 spaces in front of the 12.40 for a total width of 8 including the decimal point

    //Thousands separator flag (,)
    //Used to display numbers with a thousands separator
    System.out.printf("%,d", 12345);
    //Returns 12,345

    System.out.printf("%,.2f", 12345.56789);
    //Returns 12,345.57


    //     ACCEPTING USER INPUT
    //To accept user input use the following
    import java.util.Scanner

    //Create the "Scanner" object and pass "System.in" as an argument
    //"System.in" tells the compiler that you want to get input from the standard input device
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    //The Scanner class contains some methods that can be used to read input from the user to include "nextInt()", "nextDouble()", "nextLine()", for reading "int", "double", and "String" data types.


    //     CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS
    //  COMPARISON OPERATORS

    //Not equal (!=)
    //Returns true if the left is not equal to the right
    5 != 2 is true
